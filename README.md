## Summary
The results of the analysis show that the Vine program reviews have a higher percentage of 5 star reviews (51%) than the non-Vine reviews (39%). This suggests that there is a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. 
In addition to the analysis performed we could also look at the distribution of all star-levels across Vine and non-Vine reviews. We should also look at diferent product datasets to determine if there is also a positive bias or not.
